# Space Theme Setup

## Adding the Starfield Background

To complete the Space theme setup:

1. Save your starfield image as `starfield.jpg`
2. Place it in the `public/images/` directory
3. The theme will automatically use it as the background

## File Structure
```
public/
  images/
    starfield.jpg  <- Place your image here
```

## Theme Features

The Space theme includes:
- **Starfield background**: Your custom space image (with CSS fallback)
- **Glass-morphism cards**: Semi-transparent with backdrop blur
- **Enhanced shadows**: Deep shadows for floating effect
- **Space colors**: Light blue primary, purple accents
- **Backdrop blur**: Creates depth and readability

## Removing the Theme System

If you need to remove the entire theme system:

1. Delete these files:
   - `src/contexts/ThemeContext.jsx`
   - `src/components/ThemeSettings.jsx`
   - `src/styles/themes.scss`

2. In `src/App.jsx`:
   - Remove theme imports
   - Replace `AppContent`/`ThemeProvider` with direct component
   - Remove theme-related props and classes

3. The app will revert to the original single theme
